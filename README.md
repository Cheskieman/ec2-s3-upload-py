# Uploading a File from an EC2 Instance to S3 Using Python

## A fully functional step-by-step EXAMPLE for How to Create a Python File in AWS EC2 to upload to an AWS S3 Bucket

###  This project will display a PERFECT AND SIMPLE EXAMPLE on how to integrate a variety of WEB APPLICATIONS and have them all work in synchronization. In this project, we will be covering how to:

* Create  the neccasary IAM role and attach it to a newly created EC2 instance
* Create a custom Python file to upload to an EC2 instance
* Write additional lines of code in the EC2 instance to properly embed the custom Python file 
* Create the neccasary files in EC2 to then be stored in the S3 bucket
* Create an S3 bucket as well as a file that will store the information that we created with the Python file that we uploaded to the EC2 instance

  #### Instructions on How to upload a Python File to an EC2 instance & S3 bucket.


  1. Launch an EC2 Instance> Create an IAM Role with Full S3 access> Attach the Role to Your EC2 Instance>Create an S3 Bucket
  2. Prepare your Python Script & Connect to the EC2 Instance using EC2 Instance Connect>Create a Python File to Paste Your Python Script in the EC2 Instance Connect terminal
  3. Make the Script Executable> Create an Empty File to Upload> Add Content to that File.
  4. Create again same Python File to paste again same Python Script in the EC2 Instance Connect terminal
  5. Make the Script Executable> Create an Empty File to Upload> Add Content to that File.
  6. Install additional required Python Library command & Install command to intergrate EC2 Terminal with S3 bUCKET
  7. Create a New Folder Inside Your S3 Bucket
  8. Back in the EC2 Terminal, Create a Test File & Run the Upload Script
  9. Verify inside Your S3 Bucket if the Test File Was Created.
